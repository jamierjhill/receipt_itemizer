# Receipt Itemizer App - README

This was my first brain wave when I had to pick up a large bill from a restaurant the other day. Went home and created this is one night. It allows a user to split a receipt between 'eaters' depending on what everyone had. The outputs were shared via PDF and a breakdown per person provided. The idea is to get this on pythonanywhere and also include a photo -> text feature to prevent someone manually copying out the receipt.
